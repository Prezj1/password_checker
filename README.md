# password_checker
 A password checker made using python
 
 This script connects to the pwned api and checks to see if your password has been hacked. The passwords are parsed through from the password.txt file and shown in the console. I have used the top 100 most common passwords from 2021 from Techcult as an example. You can find this list on this link here https://techcult.com/most-common-passwords/
